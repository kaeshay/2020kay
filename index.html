		<p class="text">Jeffrey arrived - I was so so happy! On this evening, we decided to switch out his wooden bed with the metal day bed in the living room because the wooden one was too squeaky. The metal bed frame couldn't fit through the sliding doors so we had to disassemble it but all the rods fell down and it took us until 2am to figure out how to piece it back together. A very frustrating but memorable night.</p>
